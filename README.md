### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Gabriel and I'm a software developer currently finishing up my computer science degree at Brock University.
I'm currently working For a Saas Start up called Mely.ai as a full stack developer. We offer our client, transport logistics companies, a solution to their problems with document processing! Once my work term finishes I plan to go back to school full time and finish my degree
